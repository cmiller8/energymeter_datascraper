by Clayton Miller on Sept 28, 2016

[Please click on the main jupyter notebook to see the code used to create the dataset](https://github.com/cmiller8/energymeter_datascraper/blob/master/Energy%20Meter%20Data%20Scraping.ipynb) 

A Python file could be extracted from this notebook that could be used to continously collect data...

To use the script, one could simply run the script on a linux machine or use a Windows process to continuously collect 5 min data forever: http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/executing-tools/scheduling-a-python-script-to-run-at-prescribed-times.htm
